User Support
============

Do you:

* Have a problem related to the OzSTAR supercomputers that you are having trouble solving?
* Need help with installing your software?
* Are about the best or preferred way to launch a job?
* Have some code that is crashing or not working as expected (but has worked for you before or on other systems)?
* Are experiencing something mysterious that you don't fully understand?

Feel free to send a ticket through to our user support email address: hpc-support@swin.edu.au

.. note::
    OzSTAR supercomputing does not have dedicated support services. Support is provided on a best-effort basis by the HPC technical staff (a small team), and we will try to get back to you as soon as possible. Our resources are limited, so some requests will be out of scope and politely declined.

---------
To assist us with solving your problem, please provide as much information as you can in your request.

For a general or job related query:

#. The issue you're having
#. The Job ID (where applicable)
#. Your username
#. Full list of steps to reproduce the issue
#. Debug output for us:
    * The output of `module list`
    * The output of `printenv`
#. The expected result
#. The result you're actually getting


For a software installation, we generally encourage you to install your own software. See :ref:`Installing New Software`. If a software package is stable and widely used by several groups on the supercomputer, we may consider installing it as a module. If you would like us to consider installing a new module, please specify:

#. The name of the package you would like installed
#. Where we can obtain the source code to build from or the installer
#. How many people will be using this package
#. Any other information you think is relevant
