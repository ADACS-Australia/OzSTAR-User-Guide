Linux tutorials
===============

The OzSTAR Supercomputer uses `AlmaLinux 9 <https://almalinux.org>`_ as the main operating system. AlmaLinux is binary-compatible with `Red Hat Enterprise Linux <https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux>`_ (RHEL), so most RHEL documentation will also be relevant for AlmaLinux. We advise that you make yourself familiar with the Linux operating system and the use of command line before using the supercomputer.

You can find a comprehensive Unix/Linux tutorial on http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/.
