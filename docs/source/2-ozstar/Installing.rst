Installing New Software
=======================

Users are permitted and encouraged to build and install software on the OzSTAR
supercomputer. In most cases, this is the preferred option, because it allows
users to configure their software to meet their needs exactly, and install new
updates as needed.

Whether you are compiling a code that you have developed yourself, or installing
an established package, you can use the provided toolchains for the build
process.

If you are unsure how to install your software package, please contact support
and we will do our best to assist.
